Currently this repository is set up to work as an Eclipse project and has JARs and library source
code attached.  The JOGL OS specific files (DLLs on Windows) need to be downloaded and put in the
root of the project directory.  It shouldn't be too hard to get working in NetBeans, but for
consistency Eclipse is recommended.
