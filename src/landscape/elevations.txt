# This file contains elevation points for Willamette University.
# It is used to generate the landscape the campus model sits on.
# 
# Building's maintain their own elevations, as will other objects eventually
# 
# Each line with content which does not start with a '#' is an
# elevation datum.  It should contain three whitespace separated
# decimal numbers - the Easting followed by the Northing (of the
# Oregon North State Plane Coordinate System) followed by the 
# elevation from sea level.  All measurements are international feet.
# 
# The best resource for these measurements as of this writing is
# Campus Blueprints/campus_plans_maps/CAMPUS MAPS 3-20-07/Willamette Map_decimal.dwg
# The file appears to have a unique number next to each elevation point,
# try to incorporate that with each recorded elevation.
# 

#
# Corners of Main Campus
# For now, they're left at elevation 0, replace the 0 elevation lines with
# the commented points to set the corners of campus to the correct elevation.
