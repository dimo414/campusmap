# This file contains elevation points for Willamette University.
# It is used to generate the landscape the campus model sits on.
# 
# Building's maintain their own elevations, as will other objects eventually
# 
# Each line with content which does not start with a '#' is an
# elevation datum.  It should contain three whitespace separated
# decimal numbers - the Easting followed by the Northing (of the
# Oregon North State Plane Coordinate System) followed by the 
# elevation from sea level.  All measurements are international feet.
