# Status

This is an overview of all the work done and still needing to be done on the Campus Map:

Note that there are TODOs and FIXMEs scattered throughout the codebase, indicating
issues that need to be addressed in the future.  Pay attention to them.

## Buildings:

* Not Started:
  * AGSM Mudd Building
  * Atkinson Annex
  * Centers for Academic Excellence
  * Executive Building and GSE
  * Hallie Ford Museum of Art
  * Haseldorf Apartments
  * Kaneko Commons / TIUA
  * Mahoney Building
  * McCulloch Stadium and Athletics Complex
  * Oregon Civic Justice Center
  * Physical Plant West
  
* Footprint Placed:
  * Alpha Chi House
  * Art Building
  * Baxter Hall
  * BMC
  * Collins Hall
  * Delta Gamma House
  * Eaton Hall
  * Ford Hall
  * Gatke Hall

  * Sparks Field House
  * Westside Complex
  * WISH and Admissions
  
* Modeling In Progress:
  * Goudy Commons - minor fixes in the roof, building misspositioned
  * Putnam University Center - pillars or 2nd floor slightly offset, missing east stairwell
  * University Apartments - roof structure not quite accurate
  
* Modeling Largely Complete:
  * Clock Tower
  * Grounds Building
  * Waller Hall
  
* Highly Detailed Models and/or Textured Models:
  *  None

## Objects / Monuments:

The Star Trees, the Hatfield Fountain (Chicken Fountain), and other notable objects
around campus should be designed and placed.  This can include things like pillars,
bridges, lamp posts, trees, parking lots, playing fields, and other outdoor structures.

## Elevations:

With the exceptions of the four corners of campus, the elevations of the ground have
not been recorded.  This should be easy to do, but a lot of data points are needed - 
at the very least one or two should be found per building, and both the building and
src/landscape/elevations.txt need to be updated to reflect this data.

## Mill Stream:

Once the landscape is elevated properly, there should be a recession in the ground where
the mill stream runs.  It may be as simple as placing a blue plane at the proper elevation
which is underground everywhere except where the mill stream should be seen.

## Paths:

This is the most complicated part of the project, insofar as how to do it hasn't been
solved yet.  The problem is complicated because the landscape triangulation algorithm
is not predictable, and as such the paths cannot simply be statically plotted over the ground.

Possibilities include:

* Including elevations for the path at all necessary points in elevations.txt

  This *would* mean we could simply build a static Path object that gets drawn over the ground
  We may not however have enough data to successfully do that

* Processing the shape generated by the triangulator at runtime to dynamically overlay the paths.

  This seems like the most robust solution
  Could be quite challenging to implement

* Lay the paths down transparently in 2 dimensions at 0 elevation but with infinite height
  (so the invisible path-blocks cut through the landscape) and wherever they intersect with
  the ground the ground changes color.
 
  This would be ideal in terms of ease of implementation
  But I don't know if something like this is possible in OpenGL

## User Interface:

* Eye Collision Detection:

  Currently there's a (poor) collision detection preventing the eye from going below 0
  elevation.  This is decent for now, but needs to be much more robust once accurate
  elevations are implemented, and if possible ought to prevent flying inside buildings
  and other objects as well as below ground.
