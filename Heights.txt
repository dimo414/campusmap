Since Willamette University does not have any easy to access / standardized resources
detailing building heights, we have had to go around campus measuring heights ourselves.
This document contains the measurements we have made.

All measurements should be treated as approximations at best, however measurements starting
with a '~' are outright educated guesses.

The primary technique used to measure heights is detailed in the "Pencil Method" of this
website: http://www.wikihow.com/Measure-the-Height-of-a-Tree
In summary, you line a small object up with the vertical distance to measure, then turn
it horizontal and measure the distance along the ground covered by the small object.

This document should be treated as the primary reference for campus building heights, and
updated as necessary.  When other files in this project differ from this document, they
should be presumed to be incorrect.
